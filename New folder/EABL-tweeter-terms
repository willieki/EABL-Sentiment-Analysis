The cost of sales rose 10.1% year-over-year, faster than the marginal rise in revenues of 0.2% as the operating environment got worse and inflation picked up in H2 2023 as compared to H1 2023. Moreover, indirect taxes grew by 4.2% to KES 87.9B and accounted for 44.5% of gross sales [2022: 43.6%]. This is the worst year-on-year decline in gross profits in the last decade, bringing the gross margin to 43.2%, down from 48.3%. ******************************************************* “Inflation really picked up across all the markets and when you look at our inputs, ethanol was scarce throughout H2 and that started late in H1 and picked in H2. We are having to now source ethanol at 60% above what we were buying before, so it is like a 61% inflation on ethanol, grain is almost 31% following the drought, glass following the excise increments we are buying that at 20% above and that follows transport and logistics, electricity 40% so you can see just from an inflation perspective, we’ve seen immense pressures come through and I think all the consumers are feeling this across our countries"" - EABL CFO Risper Genga [@risperg] *******************************************************  ******************************************************* Profitability: EABL’s net profits for the year were down 21% to KES 12.3B, lowering the net margin by 300 basis points to 11.2% [2022: 14.2%]. This is still the second-highest absolute net profit in the last decade.  ******************************************************* Depressed Dividends: The final dividend proposed of KES 1.75 per share is far below the final one of KES 7.25 proposed last financial year. This brings the company’s total dividend for FY 2023 to KES 5.5 per share [2022: KES 11]. The market was unhappy with the results, pushing the share price down by 6.7% on Friday to KES 153.5. ******************************************************* Extra: One interesting slide from the EABL presentation is how Kenyans are allocating their spending pre and post-Covid: ******************************************************* For more read in our newsletter this week: https://mwangocapital.substack.com/p/01-08-2023-eabl-profits-decline *******************************************************","Aug 1, 2023 · 3:27 PM UTC","{'comments': 2, 'retweets': 4, 'quotes': 1, 'likes': 9}",Negative

Through their investment in innovation and research, EABL has managed to provide improved varieties that are disease resistant, leading to higher and better quality yields. This is a significant step towards mitigating and adapting to the effects of climate change.  It is gratifying to note that EABL's interventions align with the flagships under the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS), the Government manifesto, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on zero hunger, decent work, and economic growth. These efforts demonstrate that private sector entities can deploy business strategies that go beyond profit maximization and respond to the challenges faced by communities at all levels.  I would like to give a special acknowledgement to the success of EABL's contractual farming program, which enables the company to source raw materials locally. Additionally, their partnership with Sight Savers to mobilize persons with disabilities for inclusion in the supply chains is commendable.

At first glance, it looks like the kind of message that your customer would be angry with you for blocking if they spotted this in their spam folder. But this was actually a criminal spam sent from ""mxbaus AT gmail[.]com"" - which is some thug criminal's email address - one of many used by this criminal. As I was researching this to be extra sure, I came across a FaceBook post from a small business that this scammer also attempted to scam. And once this business started reporting these addresses and their criminal schemes - he started getting death threats from these criminals. Here's the Facebook page where this is discussed:   https://www.facebook.com/Nlseasonings/posts/pfbid02pwxhWJzhdHrSPRjRW4D48uj43wDyrB4KXToAWh4SThBVBLij5DsJFaTok4eV23mPl  This particular email address probably didn't send him the original scam - that came in a later scam spam that is mentioned in the post author's follow-up comment on this FaceBook post (see above link). For these scam spams, the specifics of the actual scam comes in a follow-up reply - so that they can make their initial scam spam more innocent-looking - just like this one - and that makes it HARD for spam filters to block these. They're hard to distinguish from legit order inquiries from legit potential customers. But our EABL list is ""threading the needle"" on that!  So, again, these are extremely hard for a spam filter to block - but our EABL is catching many of these.
