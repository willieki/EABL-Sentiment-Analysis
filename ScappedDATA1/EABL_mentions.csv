Cuz he didn’t fight for better healthcare for you, not better pay, lower taxes, lower drug prices, or safer bridges, he didn’t fight to lower the national debt, bring back coal or to make Mexico pay for his dumb wall.  He tried to ban Muslims from coming here. He swore. He bragged about rape. He said out loud the bigoted things you used to have to whisper. He mocked a disabled reporter. He demeaned women of color. He made up nicknames for the Dems you don’t like. He promised to “lock her up!” And none of that did a damn real thing “for you.”  He’s never “fought for you.” He’s not “fighting for you” now. He’s a bigoted, foul-mouthed, women-hating sexual predator so utterly depraved that he has taken pleasure in mocking someone’s physical disability. He’s a soulless, nepotistic criminal conman who in truth finds everything about you physically repulsive, but he also knows that you’re dumb enough and hateful enough that he can use you and toss you away in the span of a single thumbs up.  But sure, send him your money. Buy his Chinese-made merch. Because with your money, he’s fighting “for you” to shield himself from the law by getting back into the office he used you to help him try to steal. I’m sure he’ll remember you just like he did all those J6ers he’s left sitting in prison cells.  And when he takes that social security you’ve been paying into your whole working life & raises your taxes I’m sure he’ll flash that signature thumbs up. And then you’ll feel much, much better.

This is what justice looks like...  Christopher Worrell was convicted of seven counts at a bench trial last year after he sprayed police during the Capitol insurrection.  At his sentencing, he claimed that his treasonous actions were ""inexcusable and unjustified,"" that he was ""truly sorry"" to Congress and law enforcement, and that he had come to ""sincerely regret"" his choice.  The apology proved to be entirely inauthentic as Worrell later failed to appear at a sentencing hearing. A bench warrant was issued for his arrested, the FBI issued an alert, and he was captured weeks later.  Bizarrely, when authorities arrested him he faked a drug overdose by posing beside an opioid prescription in the hopes of delaying the inevitable consequences of his actions. Emergency procedures were applied and he was rushed to the hospital. It turned out to be a ruse.  This traitor belong  in prison for a very long time — and that's exactly what he's getting.

Republicans are just playing politics.  Let's all remember in 2013 Senate Democrats passed a bipartisan immigration reform bill in the Senate.  Republicans refused to even debate the bill.  Obama asked them to write their own bill, they refused.  In his first days of office Joe Biden proposed an immigration bill he titled The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 “to responsibly manage and secure our border, keep our families and communities safe, and better manage migration across the Hemisphere.”  The Senate Republicans wanted no part of it.  Republicans are just POS who use immigration as a political ploy to go after Democrats but when push comes to shove they vote against immigration reform every damn time.  They just lie, create chaos and hurt people, including immigrants to America.  #GOPClownShowContinues #StopGOPLies #FreshResists",,"Jan 3, 2024 · 2:41 PM UTC","{'comments': 576, 'retweets': 3275, 'quotes': 161, 'likes': 5511}"

They're more like scare tactics than anything based in reality. First off, your claim about human traffickers causing deaths, it’s tragic, sure, but pinning it on immigrants as a whole? That’s just wrong. Research shows undocumented immigrants are actually less likely to commit crimes than U.S. citizens. Your narrative? It's fearmongering, plain and simple.  And this bit about Secretary Mayorkas inviting an 'invasion' and having blood on his hands? Come on. Immigration is complex, and blaming one person for a tragic incident is oversimplifying to the extreme. You’re painting a picture that just doesn’t exist in reality.  Saying Americans are getting 'slaughtered' on their way to see families? That's an outright exaggeration. It stokes unnecessary fear. The truth? Immigrants are less likely to commit crimes. Your statements are doing nothing but spreading panic.  Now, about lives lost due to open border policies, that's just a LIE. There’s no evidence linking Secretary Mayorkas's policies to increased crime or death. In fact, higher immigration rates are associated with lower violent and property crime rates.  Let's not forget your repeated attention-seeking over tragedies. Rather than offering solutions, you're just fanning the flames of fear and hatred. And your claim about '10 MILLION illegals'? Grossly inflated. The real numbers don't even come close. You're not helping; you're just spreading misinformation.  And about drugs, yes, drug smuggling is an issue, but saying 'Drugs are pouring in' while ignoring the increase in drug seizures? That's misleading. It overlooks the effectiveness of border enforcement.  Human trafficking is a serious problem, but linking it directly to illegal border crossings is deceptive. And this claim about terrorists infiltrating America through the southern border? It's a distortion of reality, they've got caught. You are shifting focus from the more critical issue of homegrown extremism.  Lastly, calling for impeachment over Secretary Mayorkas's actions, that's just political posturing. Disagreement over policy is not the same as breaking the law. This is more about creating a spectacle than upholding legal standards.  2024 can't come soon enough. It's time for voters to see through this charade. 🤡 #Immigration #Border",,"Jan 3, 2024 · 5:55 PM UTC","{'comments': 74, 'retweets': 137, 'quotes': 6, 'likes': 693}"

The cost of sales rose 10.1% year-over-year, faster than the marginal rise in revenues of 0.2% as the operating environment got worse and inflation picked up in H2 2023 as compared to H1 2023. Moreover, indirect taxes grew by 4.2% to KES 87.9B and accounted for 44.5% of gross sales [2022: 43.6%]. This is the worst year-on-year decline in gross profits in the last decade, bringing the gross margin to 43.2%, down from 48.3%. ******************************************************* “Inflation really picked up across all the markets and when you look at our inputs, ethanol was scarce throughout H2 and that started late in H1 and picked in H2. We are having to now source ethanol at 60% above what we were buying before, so it is like a 61% inflation on ethanol, grain is almost 31% following the drought, glass following the excise increments we are buying that at 20% above and that follows transport and logistics, electricity 40% so you can see just from an inflation perspective, we’ve seen immense pressures come through and I think all the consumers are feeling this across our countries"" - EABL CFO Risper Genga [@risperg] *******************************************************  ******************************************************* Profitability: EABL’s net profits for the year were down 21% to KES 12.3B, lowering the net margin by 300 basis points to 11.2% [2022: 14.2%]. This is still the second-highest absolute net profit in the last decade.  ******************************************************* Depressed Dividends: The final dividend proposed of KES 1.75 per share is far below the final one of KES 7.25 proposed last financial year. This brings the company’s total dividend for FY 2023 to KES 5.5 per share [2022: KES 11]. The market was unhappy with the results, pushing the share price down by 6.7% on Friday to KES 153.5. ******************************************************* Extra: One interesting slide from the EABL presentation is how Kenyans are allocating their spending pre and post-Covid: ******************************************************* For more read in our newsletter this week: https://mwangocapital.substack.com/p/01-08-2023-eabl-profits-decline *******************************************************",,"Aug 1, 2023 · 3:27 PM UTC","{'comments': 2, 'retweets': 4, 'quotes': 1, 'likes': 9}"
